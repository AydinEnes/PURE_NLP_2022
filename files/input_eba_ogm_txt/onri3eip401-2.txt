KONU Eï¿½EYSï¿½Z ï¿½REME-1

 

Eï¿½eysiz ï¿½remenin ï¿½zellikleri:

) Ana canlï¿½nï¿½n dï¿½llenme olmaksï¿½zï¿½n yeni bireyler
oluï¿½turmasï¿½na eï¿½eysiz ï¿½reme denir.

) Eï¿½eysiz ï¿½remeyle oluï¿½an yeni canlï¿½lar, birbiriyle ve ana
canlï¿½yla aynï¿½ genetik ï¿½zelliklere sahiptir.

) Eï¿½eysiz ï¿½remenin temeli mitoza dayanï¿½r. Tek bir ata
canlï¿½nï¿½n olmasï¿½ yeterlidir.

) ï¿½oï¿½alma hï¿½zï¿½ yï¿½ksektir. Kï¿½sa sï¿½rede ï¿½ok sayï¿½da yavru
bireyler oluï¿½ur.

) Eï¿½eysiz ï¿½reme tek hï¿½crelilerin, bitkilerin, mantarlarï¿½n ve
hayvanlarï¿½n bazï¿½larï¿½nda gï¿½rï¿½lï¿½r.

Eï¿½eysiz ï¿½reme ï¿½eï¿½itleri:
Bï¿½lï¿½nerek ï¿½reme
Tomurcuklanma

Sporla ï¿½reme
Rejenerasyon
Partenogenez

Bitkilerde vejetatif ï¿½reme

1.Bï¿½lï¿½nerek ï¿½reme

) Bï¿½lï¿½nerek ï¿½reme, prokaryot canlï¿½larda ve tek hï¿½creli
ï¿½karyotlarda gï¿½rï¿½lï¿½r.

) Bï¿½lï¿½nerek ï¿½reme, en hï¿½zlï¿½ ï¿½reme tipidir.

2. Tomurcuklanma

) Tomurcuklanmayla ï¿½reme tek hï¿½creli bir mantar ï¿½eï¿½idi
olan bira mayasï¿½nda ve hayvanlardan hidra, mercan gibi
canlï¿½larda gï¿½rï¿½lï¿½r.

3. Sporla ï¿½reme

) Bazï¿½ mantar ve alglerde; eï¿½relti
otu, kara yosunu gibi ï¿½iï¿½eksiz
bitkilerde ve sï¿½tma hastalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½na yol
aï¿½an Plasmodium ma/aria gibi bir
hï¿½creli canlï¿½larda gï¿½zlenir.

 

4. Rejenerasyonla ï¿½reme

) Birï¿½ok canlï¿½, deï¿½iï¿½ik nedenlerle zarar gï¿½ren ya da kopan
vï¿½cut parï¿½alarï¿½nï¿½ yenileme ï¿½zelliï¿½ine sahiptir. Bu ï¿½zelliï¿½e
rejenerasyon denir.

) Bazï¿½ canlï¿½lar kopan vï¿½cut parï¿½alarï¿½nï¿½n eksik kï¿½sï¿½mlarï¿½nï¿½
tamamlayarak yeni canlï¿½lara dï¿½nï¿½ï¿½ï¿½r. Bu ï¿½ekilde gerï¿½ekleï¿½en
eï¿½eysiz ï¿½reme ï¿½eï¿½idine rejenerasyonla ï¿½reme adï¿½ verilir.

) Bir yassï¿½ solucan tï¿½rï¿½ olan planaryada ve deniz yï¿½ldï¿½zï¿½nda

rejenerasyon ile ï¿½reme gï¿½rï¿½lï¿½r.
5. Partenogenez

) Dï¿½llenmemiï¿½ yumurta hï¿½cresinin mitozla geliï¿½erek yeni
birey oluï¿½turmasï¿½na partenogenez denir.

) Canlï¿½larda haploit (n) ve diploit (2n) olmak ï¿½zere iki ï¿½eï¿½it
partenogenez gï¿½rï¿½lï¿½r.

) Bal arï¿½larï¿½, yaban arï¿½larï¿½ ve birï¿½ok karï¿½ncada gï¿½rï¿½len
partenogenezde haploit (n kromozomlu) bireyler oluï¿½ur.

) Bazï¿½ balï¿½klar, ï¿½ift yaï¿½amlï¿½ canlï¿½lar ve sï¿½rï¿½ngenlerde gï¿½rï¿½len
partenogenezde ise diploit (2n kromozomlu) bireyler oluï¿½ur.
